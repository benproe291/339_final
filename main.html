        <p>EDM consists of a collection of subgenres such as House, Drum n Bass, Dubstep, Trap, and Hardstyle. The genre
          had been dormant in the nightclub scene since the 1980s, however, in recent years the demand for EDM has taken
          over commercial music by storm. </p>

        <h2>EDM is Born</h2>
        <p>In the early 20th century, composers began redefining the concept of instruments and organized sound, in turn
          redefining music. With modernism, futurism and postmodernism musical blending together, a new era of music was
          born. Delia Derbyshire was arguably the first electronic music producer and synthesist of her time. Her
          revolutionary “Doctor Who” theme and seminal album of 1969; “An electronic storm” is recognized by many. The
          bulk of her production material and influential sound for television and radio programs is still in the BBC
          Sound archives, but due to BBC copyright, she was never properly credited for her work.

        <h2>The Birth of Disco</h2>
        <p>Moving onto the 70s and the birth of Disco, the first wave of club dance music was born. Also known as Euro
          dance (Euro-trash), Disco saw the mix of Funk, Soul and smooth jazz-fusion with electronic aspects. There was
          now demand and popularity that came with clubs employing DJs, as it had turned into a club
          must-have.<br>Giorgio Moroder contributed to the use of electronic sounds and constant percussive beats that
          initially started the repetitive rhythms we hear in electronic music today. Electronic artists such as
          Kraftwerk and Donna Summer incorporated early electro and house, using Roland TR-808s, TR-909 drum machines
          and the Roland TB-303 bass synthesizer.</p>

        <h2>Early Rave</h2>
        <p>In the 80s and 90s, House, industrial, freestyle and Techno, sub-genres began gaining popularity. Acid house
          and the early Rave scene were trending in Germany and the UK, and with them came warehouse and underground
          parties that were dedicated to the growing EDM culture. Club-goers were faced with a 2 a.m. closing time in
          the UK, and would seek after-hours refuge at all-night warehouse parties.<br>In 1989, approximately 10,000
          people at a time would attend commercially organized underground parties that were eventually labelled as
          “Raves”. EDM achieved limited exposure in America during the 90s when it was marketed as "electronica".
          Electronic music acts from the UK, such as The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers and Fatboy Slim, became
          associated with the "American electronica revolution". In 1998 Madonna's Ray of Light brought the genre to
          popular music listeners. </p>
        <h3 tabindex="0">A Cultural Phenomenon</h3>
        <p>By the mid-2000s, dance music was a part of popular culture. Social media such as YouTube and SoundCloud
          assisted in fueling interest in electro house and Dubstep, popularizing Skrillex with his harsher production
          style called “bro step”.<br>EDM became heavily influenced by live events. Promoters and venues realized DJs
          could generate larger profits than traditional musicians. EDM festivals like Electric Daisy Carnival and
          Defqon grew in size, emphasising visual experiences, such as video and lighting effects. Major acts like
          Avicii and Swedish House Mafia were holding concert tours at large arenas rather than just nightclubs. In 2011
          “Spin”, announced a "new rave generation" led by David Guetta, Deadmau5, and Skrillex. In January 2013,
          “Billboard” introduced a new EDM, Dance/Electronic Songs chart, tracking the top electronic songs based on
          sales, radio airplay and online streaming. </p>
